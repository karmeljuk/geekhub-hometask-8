Symfony-Bootstrap Edition
=========================

Task8Bundle based  on the Standard Edition of [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) enriched with [twitters/bootstrap](http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap), by using the [MopaBootstrapBundle](http://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle).
It is intended to kickstart your development, serving as an alternative to [symfony-standard edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/tree/master/web), which is what symfony-bootstrap is based on!
